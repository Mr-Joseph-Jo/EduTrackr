# EduTrackr

The project is a web-based platform aimed to streamline academic performance tracking for teachers. The platform features a login system for admins and teachers ensuring secure access, file uploading, file processing and data analysis to provide actionable insights.
The platform enables admins to create, edit, and delete classes and batches, as well as assign specific teachers to classes and subjects. Teachers can view their assigned classes and subjects. It offers Data Visualization through interactive charts that highlight attendance trends, subject performance, CGPA distribution, and batch-wise comparisons.
Teachers can easily identify top-performing students and those requiring additional support with features like Top Performer Highlighting and Low Performer Identification.
The system includes Attendance Management to monitor and flag low attendance. Additionally, the platform facilitates downloading detailed reports for each class and batch, making it a valuable tool for improving academic oversight and decision-making. By bridging the gap between traditional assessment methods and modern technology, EDUTRACKR supports educational institutions in achieving excellence and improving student outcomes.
